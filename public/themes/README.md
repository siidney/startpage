# Siidney Presents
## startpage themes

The themes presented here are just some examples of the things you can do with
this startpage.

I am in no way a designer. As you will be able to tell by browsing the styles
within...

To use any of them simply copy the index.html file to your root installation
directory and any css/js files to their respective directories.

To remove them do the same.

You can also simply copy over the index.html to you root and link to the css/js
files from there without moving them. Completely up to you.

It is recommended to read through the stuff in the skel directory to get you up
to speed with understanding how everything works.
