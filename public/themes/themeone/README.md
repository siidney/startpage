What follows is the first of many themes. Well, as many as I can be bothered to
make anyway.

It's simple, it's basic and it's totally different from the default theme to
showcase just what can be done with this startpage.

To use this theme simply replace the index.html file in your installation root
dir with this one and copy the css/js files to their respective folders.

*To fully understand the startpage functionality it is recommended to read
through the files in the skel theme*
