# ThemeTwo

The next theme in the start page theming example series.

It's simple, it's basic and it's totally different from the default and themeone
themes to showcase just what can be done with this startpage.

Everything is styled using pure css. There is only a small javscript file to
move the position of the bookmarks to their corresponding panels.

It uses the Microsoft colour palette as I'm no designer and couldn't be doing
with spending the time necessary to find compatible colours.

The tag list jumping up and down is a bit funky. Aside from that though this is
pretty darn coolio.

To use this theme simply replace the index.html file in your installation root
dir with this one and copy the css/js files to their respective folders.

*To fully understand the startpage functionality it is recommended to read
through the files in the skel theme*
