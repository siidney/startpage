# ThemeThree

The next theme in the start page theming example series from someone who is not
a designer...

Simple, basic and different from anything that has gone before...

Everything is styled using pure css. There is only a small javscript file to
move the position of the bookmarks to their corresponding rows and for the
smoothscrolling stuff.

## Here's a screencast of it in action

To use this theme simply replace the index.html file in your installation root
dir with this one and copy the css/js files to their respective folders.

*To fully understand the startpage functionality it is recommended to read
through the files in the skel theme*
